**Initial Entry**  
*11:57am*  

This is a template entry to work on this very project.

It needs to exist so that I can prototype what the other projects' guidelines should be.

The basic format will be that each project will have a folder with and info.md project meta-data and an entries folder with a file for each entry.

The first line of an entry is "bold" and the title.

The second line of the entry is "italic" and the time of creation.

While not expecting a million entries in a day, 6 digits currently looks pleasing.

Example path of an entry:
`entries/year/month/day/######.md`
